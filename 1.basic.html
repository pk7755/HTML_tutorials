    <p style="color: blue">Prioritization is never a straightforward process. We have a lot to consider in terms of user
        needs, business value, etc. But there is also developer enthusiasm. What role, if any, should this be a factor
        in choosing what to work on?</p>
    <p style="color:blue">

        Its complicated.

        I can't comment on the prioritization by user needs, business value etc. Cause I'm not product. But as a
        engineering manager I can say happy engineers become less happy if they do not feel "heard". If you want your
        team stable and consistently bringing product value its best to mix in wins for product to build up good karma
        with their engineers.

        Maybe you read this and you say no product/business value only. We pay these people to write software you dont
        get to influence this. I would respond that people are complicated and coding is often a creative endeavor.
        Nothing kills creativity like being burnt out, upset, or tired.
